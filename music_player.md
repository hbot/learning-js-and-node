## Simple Music Player

Write a program that acts like a simple music player. The player should allow the user to:
* Load songs onto the device
* View a list of songs on the device
* Set the playback mode to either "in order" or "shuffle" (in shuffle, the ordering is randomized, but a song won't repeat until all songs are heard)
* Skip to the next or previous song (like most music players)
* Play/pause/stop the current song
* Play through the songs (the next song should start when the current song finishes)

Notes:
* No sound output is necessary. This is a fake, text-based music player.
* A plain API is fine -- no need for a GUI, and it doesn't even need to have an interactive text menu. Either some sample output or a runnable test interaction that shows the program working is fine.
* Don't worry about adding and removing songs at runtime, or changing the playback mode at runtime (assume a list of songs and playback more are given on startup)
* Ignore any advanced functionality such as volume control, looping/repeating songs, making playlists, etc. Just focus on simple playback. If it is easier to loop than to end when the songs are finished, do that, and vice versa.

Sample output is included in a separate file for reference. It does NOT have to match exactly, and your interpretation of functionality can be different as well.

Use your favourite language. Preferably something that is interpreted or compiles on *nix, but that is not a requirement.
